    "My dependent variables are highest level of schooling completed, highest level of schooling completed of respondents mother, highest level of schooling completed of respondents father, and highest degree completed. I will prioritize highest degree completed as I am unsure about if the data counts a year of school in \"years of school completed\" if a student fails and does not progress toward a degree. These intrest me because I want to understand racial inequality in education. (This is a very broad scope of what I am intrested in for the sake of this assignment and my sanity) My independent variable is race. I hypothesize that Black people will have less obtainment of degrees than white people and that Black females will have less degrees than Black males. I think that race and sex are associated with degrees completed because Black people and women are discriminated against in educational syustems. I will use the control variable sex to interact with race and degree so that I can find differences between Black male and female respondents. Sex should have an interactive relationship because it adds another aspect and layer of inequaility in education. "

If your control variable is interval ratio, convert it into an ordinal variable by creating a variable with 3 to 5 categories each with an equal range of the interval ratio variable.  Then use the new ordinal variable as your control variable to create the partial tables and graphs."

Adding a control variable helped to discover an interactive relationship between race,sex, and highest degree completed. THis does confirm my hypothesis, but not nearly to the exstent that I expected. This representations is probably caused by the public GSS data's lack of Black respondents; if there were more Black respondents, this relationship would be exagerated. "
